# TF-IDF Fraud Call Detector

## Description

A machine learning-based system that classifies call transcripts as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent** using **TF-IDF** and classifiers like **SVM**, **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Naive Bayes**. The system analyzes call content for patterns associated with fraud, helping in fraud detection for telecommunication and customer service industries.

## Features

- **TF-IDF** vectorization to preprocess and convert text data into numerical format.
- Models trained using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, and **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**.
- Ensemble prediction system to combine model outputs.
- Adjustable model hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Class imbalance handling using class weights.
